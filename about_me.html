      A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or
      meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish
      wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food
      type.[1][2][3] The sandwich began as a portable, convenient finger food in
      the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.

      According to the story, following the Earl of Sandwich's request for beef
      between two slices of bread, his friends began to order "the same as
      Sandwich".[9] The first written usage of the English word appeared in
      Edward Gibbon's journal, in longhand, referring to "bits of cold meat" as
      a "Sandwich".[18] Before being known as sandwiches, this food combination
      seems to simply have been known as "bread and meat" or "bread and
      cheese".[8] These two phrases are found throughout English drama from the
      16th and 17th centuries.

      The verb to sandwich has the meaning "to position anything between two
      other things of a different character, or to place different elements
      alternately,"[23] and the noun sandwich has related meanings derived from
      this more general definition. For example, an ice cream sandwich consists
      of a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake or biscuit.[24]
      Similarly, Oreos and Custard creams are described as sandwich biscuits
      (UK/Commonwealth) or sandwich cookies (US) because they consist of a soft
      filling between the baked layers.[25] In corporate finance, Dutch Sandwich
      and Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich refer to schemes for tax evasion.
